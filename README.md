# 🧭 STM32F407G Discovery 6-Month Learning Roadmap

> From beginner → embedded engineer | 2 hours/day | 6 months  
> Learn C, STM32 HAL, FreeRTOS, and build IoT projects.

## 📘 What’s inside
- `roadmap_6months.md` → full learning plan  
- `projects/` → project files for each month  
- `logs/` → your weekly progress and notes  

## 💡 Goal
By the end of this roadmap, you will:
- Write STM32 code in HAL & register level  
- Build FreeRTOS-based applications  
- Create IoT projects with sensors, SD card, Bluetooth

📈 *Keep committing your progress each week!*  
Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Week 3 done: GPIO interrupt + UART log"
